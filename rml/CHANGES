ReactiveML 1.09.02 (2014-01-08):
--------------------------------
 * New construct: "signal s memory v gather f in e" declares a signal
                  whose value is not reset form an instant to the other.
		  It means that when the gathering function is applied,
		  the initial value is not the default value, but the
		  last value of the signal. For example, in the following
		  process, the signal of the signal is the number of times
		  it has been emitted since the beginning of the execution.
		  The value printed at the end will be 3 (and not 1).
     let process example =
       signal count memory 0 gather (fun x y -> y + 1) in
       emit count;
       emit count;
       pause; pause;
       emit count;
       pause;
       print_int (last ?count);;
 - rmlc: bug fixes.
 * rmlbuild: do not link unix.cma and rmllib.cma by default when
             building a cma file.
 - rmlbuild: new "thread" tag for the use of the Async module.
 - examples: reactive_asco bug fixes.

ReactiveML 1.09.01 (2013-09-10):
--------------------------------
 - rmlc: bug fixes.
 - rmltop: bug fixes.


ReactiveML 1.09.00 (2013-09-09):
--------------------------------
 - New construct: non-instantaneous phrases can now be defined at
                  toplevel. For instance, it is possible to write:
       let process p = pause; print_endline "Hello World!" ;;
       let () = run p;;
 - New construct: the precedence of the run operator has been reduced.
                  Parantheses around processes with arguments
                  are no longer mandatory. For instance, it is possible
                  to write:
       let process p msg = pause; print_endline msg ;;
       let () = run p "Hello World!";;
 * New construct: new "proc" keyword to define anonymous processes
                  with argument. For instance, it is prossible to
                  write:
       let () = run (proc msg -> pause; print_endline msg) "Hello World!"
 - New construct: event configuration with values. For each construct
                  which allows to get the value of a signal, it is
                  possible to put an event configuration. For
                  instance, it is possible to write:
       await (s1(x) /\ s2(y)) \/ s3(x::y::_) in ...
 - New construct: do/until with multiple handlers. For instance, it is
                  possible to write:
       do ...
       until s1(x) /\ s2(y) -> ...
       | s1(x) when x > 10 -> ...
       | s3 -> ...
       done

ReactiveML 1.08.04 (2013-02-03):
--------------------------------
 - rmlc: simplification of effects in the reactivity analysis.
 - rmlc: new option -no_reactivity_simpl to keep reactivity effects
         without simplifications.

ReactiveML 1.08.01 (2012-06-14):
--------------------------------
 - New tool: rmlbuild, allows to build rml programs more easily using
   .rmlsim files. A foo.rmlsim would look like the following:
   /--------------
   | sim: main
   | sampling: 0.1
   | n : 100
   \--------------
   It tells the compiler that the main file is "foo.rml" has a main
   function called "main". The parameters "sampling" and "n" are not
   mandatory. They have the same semantics as the compiler's command
   line options -sampling and -n. Then the command to compile the
   program is "rmlbuild foo.rml.byte" or "rmlbuild foo.rml.native".
 - rmltop: "rmltop -i" lists known toplevel's directives.
 - New configure options:
   + "-target|--target" to choose a default compilation target ("opt"
     or "byte") The configure script will choose the best option if
     "-target" is not specified.
   + "-debug|--debug" adds "-g -dtypes" to OCAMLFLAGS and OCAMLOPTFLAGS.
 - Provide the Str library.

ReactiveML 1.05.00 (2006-08-17):
--------------------------------
* Semantics of "pre ?s" is modified.
- New constructs: "last ?s" and "default ?s".

Remark:

"pre ?s" is the value associated to the signal "s" at the previous instant (on
the base clock).

"last ?s" is the last value emitted by "s".

"default ?s" is the default value associated to "s".

"pre ?s" is equivalent to:
  if pre s then last ?s else default ?s
